Ever wondered what makes a YouTube video popular? In this project, you’ll get to play with real YouTube data to find out. You don’t need to be a data wizard to begin. You’ll learn to use Python, a programming language loved for its ease of learning, along with PySpark for handling big data. Plus, you’ll get a taste of SQL (a language for managing data) and various AWS (Amazon Web Services) tools like Athena, Glue, Redshift, and S3. These tools are big names in the data world, and you’ll learn how they work together to solve problems.

Skills you’ll develop:

Coding with Python and PySpark
Basic SQL for data management
